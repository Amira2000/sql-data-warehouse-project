## Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

- Cleansed and resolved data quality issues to ensure reliable analysis.  
- Integrated data from both sources into a **single, user-friendly data model** optimized for queries.  
- Focused on the **latest dataset only** (historical data tracking was not required).  
- Documented the **data model** for both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
